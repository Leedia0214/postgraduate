## introduce 
Welcome to my code repository! This is the collection of code projects that I have accumulated as a graduate student over the past two years. In this code repository, you will find various projects that I have completed during my learning and research process, covering multiple fields such as computer science, artificial intelligence, and data analysis. These projects are not only assignments for me in course learning, but also the results of exploring and applying the knowledge I have learned in practice. Each project is my reflection on problems and the implementation of solutions, demonstrating my growth and progress in programming, algorithm design, and problem-solving abilities. I hope these projects can inspire and help you, and I also welcome any suggestions and opinions from you. Thank you for your visit and support! Let's explore the world of code together and grow together!
